## Key Concepts

### 1. Sharded Cluster Components
- **Shards**: Each shard contains a subset of the sharded data.
- **Config Servers**: Store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster.
- **Mongos**: Query routers that direct operations to the appropriate shard(s).

### 2. Shard Keys
- Field or fields that determine how data is distributed across shards.
- Critical for performance and scalability.

## Benefits of Sharding

1. **Increased Read/Write Throughput**: Distribute client requests across shards.
2. **Increased Storage Capacity**: Each shard only needs to store a subset of the total data.
3. **High Availability**: Replica sets can be used as shards for redundancy.

## Sharding Strategies

### 1. Ranged Sharding

    subgraph "Documents by Region"
    D1[A-F] --> S1[Shard 1]
    D2[G-M] --> S2[Shard 2]
    D3[N-T] --> S3[Shard 3]
    D4[U-Z] --> S4[Shard 4]
    end

    class D1,D2,D3,D4 chunks
    class S1,S2,S3,S4 shards

`} />

- Divides data into ranges based on the shard key values.
- Good for queries on ranges of shard key values.

### 2. Hashed Sharding

<MermaidViewer diagram={`

    subgraph "Input Documents"
    I1[Doc 1: id=1] & I2[Doc 2: id=2] & I3[Doc 3: id=3] & I4[Doc 4: id=4]
    end
    
    subgraph "Hash Function"
    H[Hash Algorithm]
    end
    
    subgraph "Shard Distribution"
    S1[Shard 1] & S2[Shard 2] & S3[Shard 3]
    end
    
    I1 & I2 & I3 & I4 --> H
    H --> S1 & S2 & S3
    
    classDef docs fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b
    classDef hash fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100
    classDef shards fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#1b5e20
    class I1,I2,I3,I4 docs
    class H hash
    class S1,S2,S3 shards

`} />

- Uses a hash of the shard key value to distribute data.
- Provides more even data distribution but doesn't support efficient range queries.

## Best Practices

### 1. Shard Key Selection
- Choose a shard key that allows for even data distribution.
- Ensure the shard key is present in most queries to allow for targeted operations.

### 2. Avoid Monotonically Increasing Shard Keys
- Keys like auto-incrementing IDs can lead to hotspots on a single shard.

### 3. Use Compound Shard Keys
- Combine fields to create a more effective distribution strategy.

    subgraph "Document"
    D1[country: 'US', userId: 123]
    D2[country: 'UK', userId: 456]
    D3[country: 'US', userId: 789]
    end
    
    subgraph "Chunk Distribution"
    C1["Chunk 1 (US, 0-500)"]
    C2["Chunk 2 (US, 501-999)"]
    C3["Chunk 3 (UK, 0-999)"]
    end
    
    D1 --> C1
    D2 --> C3
    D3 --> C2
    
    classDef docs fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b
    classDef chunks fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#1b5e20
    class D1,D2,D3 docs
    class C1,C2,C3 chunks

`} />

Example:
```jsx title="Example: Shard collection"
sh.shardCollection("mydb.users", { country: 1, userid: 1 })
```

### 4. Monitor Chunk Distribution
- Regularly check the balance of chunks across shards.

## When to Consider Sharding

1. Data set approaching or exceeding single server capacity.
2. Active working set no longer fits in RAM.
3. Scaling vertically is no longer cost-effective.

## Sharding in Design Reviews

While sharding is not typically a major focus in initial design reviews, understanding its concepts is crucial for planning scalable MongoDB deployments. Here's why this topic matters and how to apply it:

### Why It Matters

1. **Future-Proofing**: Even if a client doesn't need sharding immediately, understanding the concepts allows for future-proof designs that can easily scale.
2. **Performance at Scale**: For large datasets or high-throughput systems, sharding can be critical for maintaining performance.
3. **Cost Optimization**: Sharding can be more cost-effective than continually scaling up a single server.
4. **Data Distribution**: Understanding sharding helps in designing data models and access patterns that will work efficiently in a distributed environment.
5. **Global Applications**: Sharding can support globally distributed applications by allowing data to be located closer to users.

### Applying in Design Reviews

When conducting a design review, consider the following regarding sharding:

1. **Growth Projections**: Discuss the client's data growth projections. If they expect to exceed single server capacity in the future, introduce sharding concepts.
2. **Workload Characteristics**: Analyze the application's read/write patterns. High-throughput applications might benefit from sharding even with smaller datasets.
3. **Shard Key Selection**: If sharding is a possibility, discuss potential shard keys based on the application's data model and query patterns.
4. **Data Model Impact**: Explain how sharding might influence data modeling decisions, particularly around document structure and relationships.
5. **Operational Complexity**: Discuss the operational overhead of managing a sharded cluster versus a replica set.
6. **Gradual Implementation**: Explain that applications can start with a single-server or replica set deployment and implement sharding later as needs grow.
7. **Query Patterns**: Review query patterns to ensure they will be efficient in a sharded environment, particularly focusing on the use of the shard key in queries.
8. **Global Data Distribution**: For applications with a global user base, discuss how sharding can be used to distribute data geographically.
9. **Backup and Recovery**: Discuss how sharding affects backup and recovery strategies.
10. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Emphasize the importance of monitoring in a sharded environment, particularly around chunk distribution and balancing.

## Conclusion

Sharding is a powerful tool for scaling MongoDB deployments. Proper planning and implementation of sharding strategies are crucial for maintaining performance and manageability as your data grows.

<CheckYourKnowledge>
  <question>
    Which of the following is NOT a component of a sharded MongoDB cluster?
  </question>
  <answer>
    Mongos (Query Router)
  </answer>
  <answer>
    Config Servers
  </answer>
  <answer correct>
    Load Balancer
  </answer>
  <answer>
    Shards
  </answer>
  <explanation>
    A sharded MongoDB cluster consists of three main components: shards (containing the data), config servers (storing metadata), and mongos routers (directing operations). A load balancer is not a native component of MongoDB sharding.
  </explanation>

  <question>
    What is the primary purpose of the Config Servers in a sharded cluster?
  </question>
  <answer>
    To route queries to appropriate shards
  </answer>
  <answer correct>
    To store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster
  </answer>
  <answer>
    To store user authentication information
  </answer>
  <answer>
    To balance data between shards
  </answer>
  <explanation>
    Config servers store the cluster's metadata and configuration settings, including the mapping of chunks to shards, which is crucial for the mongos routers to direct operations correctly.
  </explanation>

  <question>
    Why is using an auto-incrementing ID as a shard key generally NOT recommended?
  </question>
  <answer>
    It uses too much storage space
  </answer>
  <answer>
    It's too complex to generate
  </answer>
  <answer>
    It doesn't support range queries
  </answer>
  <answer correct>
    It can create hotspots by directing all new writes to a single shard
  </answer>
  <explanation>
    Auto-incrementing values as shard keys can create "hotspots" because all new writes will be directed to the shard handling the highest range of values, leading to uneven distribution and poor performance.
  </explanation>

  <question>
    What is the main difference between ranged and hashed sharding?
  </question>
  <answer>
    Hashed sharding requires more storage space
  </answer>
  <answer>
    Ranged sharding is always faster
  </answer>
  <answer correct>
    Hashed sharding provides more even data distribution but doesn't support efficient range queries
  </answer>
  <answer>
    Ranged sharding requires more CPU resources
  </answer>
  <explanation>
    While hashed sharding provides better data distribution by distributing data randomly across shards, it sacrifices the ability to perform efficient range-based queries that ranged sharding supports.
  </explanation>

  <question>
    When should an organization consider implementing sharding?
  </question>
  <answer>
    As soon as they start using MongoDB
  </answer>
  <answer>
    Only when they have global users
  </answer>
  <answer>
    When they need better security
  </answer>
  <answer correct>
    When their dataset is approaching single server capacity or when vertical scaling becomes cost-prohibitive
  </answer>
  <explanation>
    Sharding should be considered when a dataset is approaching or exceeding single server capacity, when the working set no longer fits in RAM, or when vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) becomes too expensive.
